We could really use your help getting this makerspace off the ground!

A sampling of some of the things we could use help with:

- Organizing events (Is there something you want to learn? Organize that class!  Want to meet other makers?  Organize a social event!)
- Graphic design
- Grant writing
- Incorporating and organizing a non-profit

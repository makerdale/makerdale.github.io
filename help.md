We could really use your help getting this makerspace off the ground!

A sampling of some of the things we could use help with:

- **Organizing events**
  *Is there something you want to learn? Organize that class!  Want to meet other makers?  Organize a social event!*
- **Teaching a skill or showing off your work at a regular event**  
  *Have you done 3D or Blender work? We'd love to see it at 3D Modeling Mondays.  Know about electronics or soldering?  Teach a short workshop at Wired Workshop!*
- **Graphic design**  
  *For this site, for flyers, and more!*
- Grant writing
- Incorporating and organizing a non-profit

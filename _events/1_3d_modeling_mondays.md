Dive into the world of 3D modeling with 
[Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnY2JdBrvaI)
and
[Fusion 360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnY2JdBrvaI) â€“ two powerful, free programs used in animation, video games, visual effects, 3D printing, mechanical engineering, and beyond. While these tools boast incredible capabilities, they can sometimes seem daunting to newcomers.

That's where we come in!

Every other Monday, join our community of beginners and experts alike. Whether you're finalizing a complex design, just starting out, or anywhere in between, we're here to collaborate, inspire, and assist.

**No experience? No problem!**  Newcomers will be directed to helpful tutorials, and there'll always be someone eager to assist if you hit a snag. If you don't have your own laptop, the library's got you covered.

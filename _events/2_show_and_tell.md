Calling all local Makers and Artisans!  Ever wanted to meet fellow Makers, DIYers, and Artisans?  Have a cool project you want to show off?  Have a project in mind but not sure you've got the skills to do it?

Come down to Happy Valley to share and talk shop with other local makers.  If you have something small, bring it!  If it's big, bring lots of pictures!  This is a great opportunity to meet, greet, and collaborate with folks of all skill levels.

The event is outdoors, but drinks are available inside. (Bring some quarters, too!)
